### Abstract

[comment]: # (Máximo 200 palabras)

Three major environmental processes are defining the biogeochemical functioning in Mediterranean pine forests. First, the particular characteristics of the Mediterranean climate, with alternance of wet and mild (or cold) winters and dry and warm (or hot) summers which restrict the optimal soil microbial activity to short periods of time, and determine unique properties of the nutrient cycling in these ecosystems. Second, the effect of the litter layer, dominated by senescent pine needles, a low quality resource for decomposing microorganisms with high C-to-N ratio, lignin, polyphenols and other recalcitrant carbon-based compounds, with great influence in decomposition rates and microbial biodiversity. Third, the frequency and intensity of forest disturbances, particularly wildfires, which are particularly common and recurrent in the Mediterranean areas, but also insect pests and parasites. These disturbances have a important impact in the inputs and outputs of nutrients and determine the short and long-term nutrient availability in Mediterranean pine ecosystems. Finally, these ecosystems are being affected by ongoing global change, including increasing nitrogen deposition rates and climate change, with decreasing precipitation rates and higher climatic variability. We will inspect the soil functioning by looking at key indicators of the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling, such as microbial biomass, soil respiration, enzyme activities, litter decomposition, and soil mineralization rates. 

### Introduction
The Mediterranean regions are featured by a high diversity of soils (Ibanez et al., 1995). The nature of these soils are shaped by the characteristics of the climate, the abrupt topography, dust deposition from the desert and the long and large influence of man (Yaalon, 1997). Winter metheorological conditions contributes to the weathering of silicate minerals and the dissolution of limestone and other calcareous rocks, while summer conditions are responsible for the formation of reddish minerals such as ferrihydrites and hematites, which have been considered as a characteristic of the   
  
 
 <span style="color:red"> From the point of soil development, the excess of rainfall over evapotranspiration
during several of the winter months, varying from a few mm to over 100 mm per winter
month, is more important than the length of the dry season. It enables moderately strong
hydrolytic weathering of silicate minerals, forming or preserving the 2:1 silicate clay
minerals, and especially enables the dissolution of limestones and other calcareous rocks
which are rather frequent in the Mediterranean region. On deep profiles, leaching of
dispersed clay minerals and their deposition as grain, pore or ped coatings (cutans) in the
argillic B horizon results in producing one of the characteristic features of Mediter-
ranean soils (Fedoroff, 1997).
The redness, or rubefication as it is frequently called, is a corollary feature resulting
from the long summer dry period. Iron compounds released from the weathering of
minerals, including iron oxyhydroxides, are precipitated as poorly crystalline ferrihy-
drites or very fine-grained hematite (Fe203) which coat the clays and the coarser
particles. It is important to remember that goethite (brown) cannot directly transform
into hematite (red) but ferrihydrite can (Fig. 2). The amounts of these pigmentary Fe
oxyhydroxides, commonly determined by dithionite extraction as Fea, are only small but
nevertheless dominate the soil colour even with a content less than 3% of Fea. It
represents some 70% of clay sized total Fe and is in the prevailing pedoenvironment, is
essentially irreversible (Schwertmann, 1993; Boero and Schwertmann, 1989; Bech et al.,
1997). It can be dissolved under reducing conditions. Sometimes the colour may be
derived from the source parent material (Blodgett et al., 1993; Yassoglou et al., 1997).
Another significant soil development feature is that much of the dissolved carbonate
in calcareous parent materials of various kinds is not completely leached out but
reprecipated in the lower part of the profile. This produces calcic horizons with nodules
of various sizes, forms and amounts, and weak or strong indurated calcrete (petrocalcic)
horizons. This process is characteristic for all semiarid climates (Nettleton, 1991) and is
especially significant for the recognition of the transition between percolative (leaching)
and non-percolative (wetting dominated) moisture regimes (Yaalon, 1983). In Mediter-
ranean climates where the cool winter rainfall (low evapotranspiration) makes leaching
effective even at low rainfall intensities, some leaching of carbonates takes place already
with 300 to 400 mm winter rainfall, though strong decalcification may need 600 to 800
mm rainfall.
The depth of carbonate reprecipitation and nodulation in the calcic horizon is a
function of rainfall intensity and amount (Yaalon, 1982; Retallack, 1994).Because of its geologic/tectonic position at the collision between two crustal plates,
the region is highly mountainous and dominated by landscapes with steep slopes and
relatively narrow valleys. Except for coastal plains, most of the Mediterranean region is
at an elevation above 300 m, and up to 2000 m. The highest peaks, above the tree line,
exceed 3000 m. Limestones and dolomites are very common soil parent materials,
though low metamorphic schists are also frequent (Stanley and Wezel, 1985).
An obvious consequence of the prevalence of steep slopes is relatively rapid erosion.
Weathering can barely keep up with the rate of erosion, resulting in mostly shallow,
weathering limited, soils (Leptosols or Cambisols - - FAO; Inceptisols or Entisols - -
US Soil Taxonomy), except on footslopes or hilly lowlands.  </span>

 <span style="color:red">Assuming a conservative mean content of 1% of insoluble limestone residue, it would
be necessary to dissolve 50 m of limestone to accumulate half a meter of soil, which
would require a time of some 2,000,000 years ( + 50%), not counting any loss by
erosion. However, the soil may grow in depth and become supplemented by eolian dust,
as it is discussed below.
</span>
  <span style="color:red">A very significant feature of the Mediterranean region is its position at the fringe of
the vast Sahara desert. Not only is there, in many places of the southern and eastern
Mediterranean zone, a sharp transition from the arid or semiarid to Mediterranean

 163
conditions, but the Sahara is also an important supplier of dust, in the past, at present,
and presumably in the future. Such dust has significantly affected the soils of the region
(Yaalon and Ganor, 1973; Simonson, 1995).
The Sahara desert is the most efficient producer and exporter of dust to the
atmosphere (Morales, 1979; Coude-Gaussen, 1991). Though most of it is transported
westward over the Atlantic (200,000,000 tons per year) as far as the Americas, there was
and is a considerable flux of dust northward to Europe and eastward to Israel and
Turkey (Yaalon and Ganor, 1979; Mattsson and Nihlen, 1996; Kubilay et al., 1997), to
the amount of some 100,000,000 tons per year. Though most of it falls into the
Mediterranean Sea as has been confirmed by actual measurements on cores and from
ships, large amounts reach the Mediterranean soil landcapes and contribute to soil
genesis (Yaalon, 1987; Rapp, 1984; Dan, 1990).
Many recent studies, using stable isotopes of quartz and other methods, have proven
that in most of the limestone-derived Terra Rossa soils in Israel, Greece, Italy and other
places the fine silt and much of the clay is of eolian origin (Jackson et al., 1982; Mizota
et al., 1988). On basalt-derived soils the presence of quartz and mica is a good indicator
of eolian origin (Galilee, Sardinia) (Singer, 1967; Sevink and Kummer, 1984), and on
quartz-dominated sandy coastal dunes the well-developed red sandy clay loam Hamra
soils (Palexeralfs) the clay could only have been derived from eolian accretion into the
profile (Dan et al., 1969). As the accreted dust is calcareous, it buffers the acidity
developed on well-leached soils and supplies enough CaCO 3 over time on soils with a
sub-percolative moisture regime to form calcic horizons.
We can, thus, conclude that practically all terrestrial soils in the Mediterranean region
were affected by the addition of eolian dust, adding significant amounts of fine soil
material. This activity started some 5,000,000 years ago when the Sahara became desert.
There is an uneven spatial distribution of dust deposition due to distance from source,
hill slopes, wind shadows, vegetation trapping, etc. Because of the slow and intermittent
accretion, ranging rom less than a micron up to 20 Ixm per year, the accreted dust
manages to become completely assimilated by the prevailing pedoenvironment, includ-
ing its colour, and is leached or bioturbated into the soil profile. Even if net dust
deposition in southern Europe is a fraction of a micron per year, on pure limestone-de-
rived soils this would amount to a considerable percentage of the accumulated soil
material (see above). Hence values of up to 50% of eolian material in hard limestone
derived soils is highly reasonable. Similar values are obtained when comparing the grain
size ratios (clay/silt) in eolian dust, limestone residues and the resulting soils (Yaalon
and Ganor, 1973).
In semiarid desert fringe regions, where the rate of dust deposition can be a few ~xm
per year, its effect on soils is correspondingly larger. Only when the rate of accumula-
tion increases to about 40 t~m/y, with high rates during intermittent dust storms, does
the dust accumulate and remain as a surface loess; a layer only subsequently subjected
to pedogenesis when the rate of accumulation decreases (Yaalon, 1987).</span>

 <span style="color:red"> Characteristic landscape attributes are the high proportion of mountains with steep slopes,
significant additions of Saharan desert dust to practically all soils of the region, and a large
proportion of limestone and other calcareous rocks as soil parent materials. Characteristic soil
behavior features are moderate weathering with pervection (leaching, lessivage) of mostly 2:1
clays into B horizons (Xeralfs; Luvisols), hematite-induced reddening of the clays due to summer
dehydration of free iron oxyhydroxides, carbonate dissolution and reprecipitation with prevalence
of calcic horizons (Xerolls; Calcisols) in semiarid regions, and development of Venisols, mostly
in lowlands, where deep layers of swelling/cracking clays have sedimented. Shallow soils on
nearly bare slopes, mostly a result of erosion subsequent to deforestation, are frequent (Leptosols,
Cambisols; Inceptisols, Entisols). Red (or Brown) Mediterranean soils are no longer used as a
separate classification group in modern, well defined, soil property-controlled taxonomies (Soil
Taxonomy; FAO system), but were partially replaced by Duchaufour's term Fersiallitic soils in
some classification systems. Terra Rossa continues to be used in some classification for hard
limestone derived red soils, mostly shallow. </span>

<span style="color:red">Concentrating on soil behavior, no doubt the same soil forming processes act in the
Mediterranean as in any other regions. Nevertheless, the relative importance of certain
processes and environmental factors differ, making the region rather unique and specific
in several respects. Clay illuviation and carbonate redistribution, in part of eolian origin,
are the main soil-forming processes.
Since temperature and moisture regime have been recognized by Soil Taxonomy and
some other systems as soil features useful in classification, the xeric moisture regime has
essentially separated the more specific soils of the region in five suborders and several
great groups. The Red (or Brown) Mediterranean soils are no longer recognized as a
separate taxonomic unit in world classification systems, though the Fersiallitic group of
soils has replaced it in the scheme of Duchaufour (1982). Some national soil classifica-
tion systems have preserved the use of the Terra Rossa name for hard limestone-derived
red soils.
Several detailed studies have shown that the landscapes and soils of most Mediter-
ranean regions are old, not necessarily monogenetic but frequently polygenetic, affected
by climatic fluctuations and also by man's management and manipulation of the
landscape. Addition of desert dust over time, incorporating it within the profile, is one of
166
 D.H. Yaalon / Catena 28 (1997) 157-169
the characteristic features o f the soil development. Erosion and truncation has accompa-
nied a severe deforestation especially on sloping lands resulting in widespread shallow
lithosols (Inceptisols and Entisols; Leptosols and Cambisols). Retransporting much of
the eroded coarse- to fine-grained colluvium and alluvium to footslopes and lowland, the
accumulated soil materials served for the development of new soils and fertile agricul-
ture over several millennia. Where fine material accumulated, dark-coloured Vertisols or
Xerolls, rather than red soils (Xeralfs) dominate the landscape.
Obtaining more detailed data on the nature of the present soil resources and a better
understanding of soil processes in the various landscapes enables us to face possible
future challenges in land use. The biggest challenge in the Mediterranean region is
increased population pressure, which may result in loss of good arable soil to urban and
other development projects, the threat to soils by pollution and erosion, and environmen-
tal change.
Global climatic change due to greenhouse gases, with its likely increase in tempera-
ture but as yet unknown but probably variable effects on the regional moisture regimes,
is likely to have variable effects on the soils. It may further decrease the soil organic
matter content and soil biological activity, due to the continuous use of chemical
pesticides and herbicides, and affect the soil moisture regime and erodibility. Further
degradation of structure may occur (Imeson and Emmer, 1992). Though other predic-
tions for change are equally pessimistic with regard to the ecosystems and land use,
especially for the drier southern regions (LeHouerou, 1990), a growing movement to
protect the remaining forests and promoting afforestation instead deforestation is gaining
acceptance. This could avoid the threat to soils, reverse the spread o f these degradation
trends, and preserve the soil resources.</span>

Soils in the Mediterranean region: what makes them
different?
Dan H. Yaalon


<span style="color:blue">One of the most common used criteria to establish whether a certain area “qualify” for being
classified as Mediterranean climate is the “xeric” (Gr. xeros, dry) Soil Moisture Regime (SMR)
of the USDA Soil Taxonomy (2006) that identifies as: “Soils of temperate areas that
experience moist winters and dry summers, in areas of xeric SMR the soil moisture control
section, in normal years, is dry in all parts for more than 45 or more consecutive days in the
four months following the summer solstice and moist in all parts for 45 or more consecutive
days in the four months following the winter solstice,......the mean annual soil temperature is
lower than 22oC, and the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature differ by 6oC or
more at a depth of 50 cm or wherever shallower........”. This paper deals with soils
surrounding the Mediterranean Sea.</span>
<span style="color:blue">Mediterranean soils are characterized by a wide diversity reflecting differences in climate,
landscape, vegetation, time and especially, the long-term influence of the human activities.
Erosion has been a dominant factor in carving landscapes and influencing soil distribution.
Some of the best-known examples of Mediterranean soils are the famous “terra rossa” or the
Rhodic and Chromic Luvisols (WRB 2006) or the Rhodoxeralfs of Soil Taxonomy (Soil
Survey Staff, 2006). However, there can be great confusion when one tries to classify these
particular soils, as they possess variable soil depths, evidences of clay translocation within the
soil profile, and age of soil development. Thus, their classification may vary from Regosols or
Leptosols to Cambisols and Luvisols (Figure 2).</span>
<span style="color:blue"> The dominant parent materials of southern Europe
and the Middle East are the limestones and dolomites that gave rise to the development of the
typical karstic ecosystem of the Mediterranean. Furthermore, special attention is needed to
understand the past and present role of wind-borne materials from the Sahara desert in the
Region’s soil formation. Following are brief descriptions of major soils using the World
Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB, 2006) terminology and classification system. Short
descriptions of soil characteristics and issues related to soil use and management are also
provided.</span>

In the absence of major disturbances, three carbon (C) and nutrient inputs pathways are responsable of soil functioning in Mediterranean pine forest. The first path is through litter decomposition (see Chapter 16) in which C and nutrients are incorporated in soluble and insoluble forms to be further proccesed by soil biota. The second important C and nutrient source for soil microorganisms comes from root exudates. Finally, dry and wet C and nutrient deposition can be also an important input of fuel for the soil functioning engine. Particularly the Mediterranean basin is frequently affected by dust inputs from the Saharan desert (cita). In Mediterranean ecosystems, fire (Chapter V), insect outbreaks (Chapter 12) and pests (Chapter 11) are major disturbances that disrupt normal soil functioning, including biota composition and activity and the cycling of essential nutrients for life (cite). In this chapter we will focus mainly in C, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) the most essential nutrients for life most frequently limiting primary and secondary production in Mediterranean ecosystems.

### Soil properties
#### pH
Mediterranean pine forest can be found in a wide range of soil pH. However in the Mediterranean areas the dominant pH range is between 6 and 8, in contrast with the more acidic soils in the temperate zones and the more basic soils of arid zones (Figure 3 and 4).

#### Organic carbon


Soils are the most important terrestrial reservoir of C, with estimates of ca. 1460 Pg of C globally (Schalemann et al. 2014). Whether soils are acting as sink or source of atmospheric C is a central issue in global change modeling and mitigation purposes. Soil organic carbon in Mediterranean ecosystems are normally low as compared with temperate ecosystems. For example, the Mediterranean basin constitute an intermediate stage between the lower values of North Africa arid ecosystems and the higher values found at latitudes comprising temperate and boreal ecosystems of Central and North Europe (Figure 1). Similar gradients of soil C can be found in the Californian and the Chilean coast, where the Mediterranean region is delimited by arid (lower carbon) and temperate (higher carbon) areas. In South Africa and Australia, the Mediterranean regions are delimited mostly by arid areas with lower soil C content (Figure 2).
