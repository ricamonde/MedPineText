Three major environmental processes are defining the biogeochemical functioning in Mediterranean pine forests. First, the particular characteristics of the Mediterranean climate, with alternance of wet and mild (or cold) winters and dry and warm (or hot) summers which restrict the optimal soil microbial activity to short periods of time, and determine unique properties of the nutrient cycling in these ecosystems. Second, the effect of the litter layer, dominated by senescent pine needles, a low quality resource for decomposing microorganisms with high C-to-N ratio, lignin, polyphenols and other recalcitrant carbon-based compounds, with great influence in decomposition rates and microbial biodiversity. Third, the frequency and intensity of forest disturbances, particularly wildfires, which are particularly common and recurrent in the Mediterranean areas, but also insect pests and parasites. These disturbances have a important impact in the inputs and outputs of nutrients and determine the short and long-term nutrient availability in Mediterranean pine ecosystems. Finally, these ecosystems are being affected by ongoing global change, including increasing nitrogen deposition rates and climate change, with decreasing precipitation rates and higher climatic variability. We will inspect the soil functioning by looking at key indicators of the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling, such as microbial biomass, soil respiration, enzyme activities, litter decomposition, and soil mineralization rates.
