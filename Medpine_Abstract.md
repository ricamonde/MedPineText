Three major environmental processes are defining the biogeochemical functioning in Mediterranean pine forests. First, the particular characteristics of the Mediterranean climate, with alternance of wet and mild (or cold) winters and dry and warm (or hot) summers which restrict the optimal soil microbial activity to short periods of time, and determine unique properties of the nutrient cycling in these ecosystems. Second, the effect of the litter layer, dominated by senescent pine needles, a low quality resource for decomposing microorganisms with high C-to-N ratio, lignin, polyphenols and other recalcitrant carbon-based compounds, with great influence in decomposition rates and microbial biodiversity. Third, the frequency and intensity of forest disturbances, particularly wildfires, which are particularly common and recurrent in the Mediterranean areas, but also insect pests and parasites. These disturbances have a important impact in the inputs and outputs of nutrients and determine the short and long-term nutrient availability in Mediterranean pine ecosystems. Finally, these ecosystems are being affected by ongoing global change, including increasing nitrogen deposition rates and climate change, with decreasing precipitation rates and higher climatic variability. We will inspect the soil functioning by looking at key indicators of the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling, such as microbial biomass, soil respiration, enzyme activities, litter decomposition, and soil mineralization rates. 

### 15.1 Introduction  

The Mediterranean regions are featured by a high diversity of soils (**Ibanez et al., 1995**). The nature of these soils are shaped by the characteristics of the climate, the abrupt topography, dust deposition from the desert and the long and large influence of man (**Yaalon, 1997**). Winter meteorological conditions contributes to the weathering of silicate minerals and the dissolution of limestone and dolomites, while summer conditions are responsible for the formation of reddish minerals such as ferrihydrites and hematites, which have been considered a typical characteristic of the Mediterranean soils. Other common properties of Mediterranean soils include the presence of an argillic B horizon as a consequence of the leaching of clay particles into deeper horizons (**Fedoroff, 1997**) and the formation of a calcic horizon by dissoluton of calcium carbonate minerals and its posterior precipitation at a deeper horizon, a process shared with other semiarid climates (**Nettleton, 1991**). Another important characteristic of the soils in the Mediterranean basin is the influence of Saharan dust on them (**Yaalon, 1997, Erel y Torrent, 2010, Zdruli et al., 2011**). For example, Erel y Torrent estimated that Al-silicates in the fine soil fraction (less than 5 μm) contained 33–86% of Saharan dust. Finally, soil erosion as a consequence of abrupt landscape and the intense human intervation lead to shallow soils (.eg. leptosols, regosols) where more pine forest can be found, since deeper soils (e.g. cambisols, luvisols) are dedicated to agriculture.    
  
In the absence of major disturbances, three carbon (C) and nutrient inputs pathways are responsable of soil functioning in Mediterranean pine forest. The first path is through litter decomposition (see Chapter 16) in which C and nutrients are incorporated in soluble and insoluble forms to be further proccesed by soil biota. The second important C and nutrient source for soil microorganisms comes from root exudates. Finally, dry and wet C and nutrient deposition can be also an important input of fuel for the soil functioning engine. Particularly the Mediterranean basin is frequently affected by dust inputs from the Saharan desert (cita). In Mediterranean ecosystems, fire (Chapter V), insect outbreaks (Chapter 12) and pests (Chapter 11) are major disturbances that disrupt normal soil functioning, including biota composition and activity and the cycling of essential nutrients for life (cite). In this chapter we will focus mainly in C, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) the most essential nutrients for life frequently limiting primary and secondary production in Mediterranean ecosystems.

### 15.2 Soil properties
#### 15.2.1 pH
Mediterranean pine forest can be found in a wide range of soil pH. However in the Mediterranean areas the dominant pH range is between 6 and 8, in contrast with the more acidic soils in the temperate zones and the more basic soils of arid zones (Figure 3 and 4). This neutral to basic pH are probable due to the sedimentary origin of a large amount of Mediterranean soils, particularly limestone and dolomites. Neutral to a acid soils are also found when are developèd on igneus and metamorphic rocks. Thus, limitation of microbial communities (such as ammonia oxidizing bacteria) or soil processes (such as nitrification rates) which occurs at low pH should not affect the functioning of most Mediterranean pine forest soils (**Nugroho et al. 2006, Lauber et al. 2008, Yao et al. 2011**). Although soil acidification by pine needles is site specific, in some cases a clear soil acidification under pine occurs (**Rutigliano et al. 2004, Iovieno et al. 2010**)

#### 15.2.2 Cation exchange capacity
Cation exchange capacity is provided by clay minerals and organic matter, and it is also influenced by pH. The combination of these three factors in the Mediterranean Areas lead to CEC ranging from 15 to 50 mmol(c)/kg (Figures 5 and 6). Although these values tended to be lower than those found under temperate climate, cation availability is unlikely to limit primary production in Mediterranean pine forests. In some cases the organic matter from pine stands showed higher CEC than other forest types for the same conditions and pH (**Gruba and Mulder, 2015**).

#### 15.2.3 Organic carbon
Soils are the most important terrestrial reservoir of C, with estimates of ca. 1460 Pg of C globally (**Schalemann et al. 2014**). Whether soils are acting as sink or source of atmospheric C is a central issue in global change modeling and mitigation purposes. Soil organic carbon in Mediterranean ecosystems are normally low as compared with temperate ecosystems. For example, the Mediterranean basin constitute an intermediate stage between the lower values of North Africa arid ecosystems and the higher values found at latitudes comprising temperate and boreal ecosystems of Central and North Europe (Figure 1). Similar gradients of soil C can be found in the Californian and the Chilean coast, where the Mediterranean region is delimited by arid (lower carbon) and temperate (higher carbon) areas. In South Africa and Australia, the Mediterranean regions are delimited mostly by arid areas with lower soil C content (Figure 2). Mediterranean pine forest have contributed to the carbon increase of soils. For example **Quideau et al. (1998)** observed an increase of 2030 g/m2 of C in the 0-1 m of the soil profile after four decades of soil development under *Pinus coulteri* in California. Similarly, **Martin-Peinado et al. (2016)** observed a significant increase in soil organic carbon (0-5cm) in pine plantations (*Pinus sylvestris, Pinus pinaster, Pinus halepensis, Pinus radiata, Pinus pinnea*) in relation to the unplanted areas), with mean values similar to those found under native forests.

#### 15.2.4 Organic nitrogen
The pattern of organic N is very similar to the organic C, with intermediate levels in the Mediterranean area as compared with the surrounding temperate and drier areas (Figures 7 and 8). However Mediterranean pine forest have a characteristic higher C:N ratio that other natives species.
