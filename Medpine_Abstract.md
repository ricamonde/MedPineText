**Abstract**  

Four major environmental processes determine the soil biogeochemical functioning in Mediterranean pine forests. (1) the typical alternation between wet and mild (or cold) winters and dry and warm (or hot) summers in the Mediterranean climate restrict soil microbial activity to short periods of time, and determine unique properties of the nutrient cycling in these ecosystems. (2) The special litter layer, dominated by senescent pine needles, a low quality resource for decomposing microorganisms with high C-to-N ratio, lignin, polyphenols and other recalcitrant carbon-based compounds. (3) The common intense and recurrent fires in the Mediterranean pine ecosystems and other disturbances like insect pests and parasites that affect the input and output of nutrients in their short and long-term availability. (4) Mediterranean ecosystems are affected also by the ongoing global climate change with decreasing precipitation and higher climatic variability that will exacerbate soil drying-wetting cycles. We will review the soil functioning in Mediterranean pine forests by looking at key indicators of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling, such as microbial biomass, soil respiration, enzyme activities, and nutrient availability.

### 15.1 Introduction  

The Mediterranean regions are featured by a high diversity of soils (Ibanez et al. 2013). The nature of these soils are shaped by the characteristics of the climate, the abrupt topography, dust deposition from the desert and the long and large influence of man (Yaalon 1997). Winter meteorological conditions contributes to the weathering of silicate minerals and the dissolution of limestone and dolomite, while summer conditions are responsible for the formation of reddish minerals such as ferrihydrites and hematites, which have been considered a typical characteristic of the Mediterranean soils. Other common properties of Mediterranean soils include the presence of an argillic B horizon as a consequence of the leaching of clay particles into deeper horizons (Fedoroff, 1997) and the formation of a calcic horizon by dissolution of calcium carbonate minerals and its posterior precipitation at a deeper horizon, a process shared with other semiarid climates (Nettleton, 1991). Another important characteristic of the soils in the Mediterranean basin is the influence of Saharan dust on them (Yaalon 1997; Erel and Torrent 2010; Zdruli et al. 2011). For example, Erel and Torrent (2010) estimated that Al-silicates in the fine soil fraction (less than 5 μm) contained 33–86% of Saharan dust. Finally, soil erosion as a consequence of abrupt landscape and the intense human intervention lead to shallow soils (e.g. leptosols, regosols and cambisols) where most native pine forest can be found, since deeper soils (e.g. luvisols) are preferentially dedicated to agriculture. Overall the Mediterranean soils have medium to low fertility (Yaalon 1997), although differences can be found between the regions under Mediterranean climate. Thus, Central Chile is considered nutrient rich (Miller 1981), and the vegetation is basically limited by water availability. California and the Mediterranean basin are also primarily limited by water and climate, but soils in these areas are less fertile, and nutrients may have a clear influence on primary production. Opposed to Chile, the Mediterranean areas of Australia and South Africa are nutrient poor, being critical factors explaining productivity and plant diversity in these areas (Wisheu et al. 2000).      

In the absence of major disturbances, three carbon (C) and nutrient inputs pathways are responsible of soil functioning in Mediterranean pine forest. The first path is through litter decomposition (see Chapter 16) in which C and nutrients are incorporated in soluble and insoluble forms to be further processed by soil biota. The second important C and nutrient source for soil microorganisms comes from root exudates (Shi et al. 2011). Finally, dry and wet C and nutrient deposition can be also an important input of fuel for the soil functioning engine (Gioda et al. 2008, Reche et al. 2009, De Vicente et al. 2012). Particularly the Mediterranean basin is frequently affected by dust inputs from the Saharan desert (Loÿe-Pilot et al. 1986). 

In Mediterranean ecosystems, fire (Chapter V), insect outbreaks (Chapter 12) and pests (Chapter 11) are major disturbances that disrupt normal soil functioning, including biota composition and activity and the cycling of essential nutrients for life (Barbero et al. 1990). In addition, the Mediterranean Basin is considered as one of the regions that will be more affected by the impacts of the climate changes on the water cycle (Ozturk et al. 2015). The decline in the availability of soil water projected for the coming decades may interact with warmer conditions and a CO<sub>2</sub>-rich atmosphere to exacerbate the water deficit (Peñuelas et al. 2005; Hernández-Santana et al. 2008; Sardans and Peñuelas 2013; Peñuelas et al. 2018). Warming can also have a direct effect on nutrient cycling during  wet winters by increasing soil enzyme activities (Sardans et al. 2006). This positive effect on winters could be counterbalanced by a lower summer water availability (Sardans and Peñuelas 2013)
  
In this chapter we will focus mainly in carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) the most essential nutrients for life and that frequently limiting primary and secondary production in Mediterranean ecosystems. I will present first the major soil properties applied to the Mediterranean areas, including the Mediterranean basin, and Mediterranean-type ecosystems in Chile, California, South Africa and Australia. Second, the chapter will concentrate in major indicators of soil functioning, with special emphasis in the flux of soil C to the atmosphere (soil respiration rate), the soil enzymes activities related to the C, N and P cycling, and nutrient availability in pine forests under Mediterranean climate.

### 15.2 Soil properties
#### 15.2.1 pH
Mediterranean pine forest can be found in a wide range of soil pH. However in the Mediterranean areas the dominant pH range is between 6 and 8, in contrast with the more acidic soils in the temperate zones and the more basic soils of arid zones (Figure 15.1). This neutral to basic pH are probable due to the sedimentary origin of a large amount of Mediterranean soils, particularly limestone and dolomite. Neutral to a acid soils are also found when are developed on igneous and metamorphic rocks. Thus, limitation of microbial communities (such as ammonia oxidizing bacteria) or soil processes (such as nitrification rates) which occurs at low pH should not affect the functioning of most Mediterranean pine forest soils (Nugroho et al. 2006; Lauber et al. 2008; Yao et al. 2011). Although soil acidification by pine needles is site specific, in some cases a clear soil acidification under pine occurs (Rutigliano et al. 2004; Iovieno et al. 2010). Rapid soil acidification has been observed in pine forests under high atmospheric nitrogen deposition (Ochoa et al. 2014).

#### 15.2.2 Cation exchange capacity
Cation exchange capacity is provided by clay minerals and organic matter, and it is also influenced by pH. The combination of these three factors in the Mediterranean areas lead to CEC ranging from 15 to 50 mmol(c)/kg (Figure 15.2). Although these values tended to be lower than those found under temperate climate, cation availability is unlikely to limit primary production in Mediterranean pine forests, but see Sardans and Peñuelas (2015). In some cases the organic matter from pine stands showed higher CEC than other forest types for the same conditions and pH (Gruba and Mulder, 2015).

#### 15.2.3 Organic carbon
Soils are the most important terrestrial reservoir of C, with estimates of ca. 1460 Pg of C globally (Schalemann et al. 2014). Whether soils are acting as sink or source of atmospheric C is a central issue in global change modeling and mitigation purposes. Soil organic carbon in Mediterranean ecosystems are normally low as compared with temperate ecosystems. For example, the Mediterranean basin constitute an intermediate stage between the lower values of North Africa arid ecosystems and the higher values found at latitudes comprising temperate and boreal ecosystems of Central and North Europe (Figure 15.3). Similar gradients of soil C can be found in the Californian and the Chilean coast, where the Mediterranean region is delimited by arid (lower carbon) and temperate (higher carbon) areas. In South Africa and Australia, the Mediterranean regions are delimited mostly by arid areas with lower soil C content (Figure 15.3). Mediterranean pine forest have contributed to the carbon increase of soils. For example Quideau et al. (1998) observed an increase of 2030 g/m2 of C in the 0-1 m of the soil profile after four decades of soil development under *Pinus coulteri* in California. Similarly, Martin-Peinado et al. (2016) observed a significant increase in soil organic carbon (0-5 cm) in pine plantations (*Pinus sylvestris, Pinus pinaster, Pinus halepensis, Pinus radiata, Pinus pinea*) in relation to the unplanted areas), with mean values similar to those found under native forests.

#### 15.2.4 Organic nitrogen
The pattern of organic N is very similar to the organic C, with intermediate levels in the Mediterranean area as compared with the surrounding temperate and drier areas (Figure 15.4). However Mediterranean pine forest have a characteristic higher C:N ratio that other natives species (Cools et al. 2014). Clear differences can be found among the different  Mediterranean areas. South Africa and Australia showed the lowest organic N content, in accordance with the characteristic low nutrient content described for these areas. Contrastingly, the Mediterranean area of central Chile showed the highest N content, with intermediate levels for the Mediterranean basin and California (Figure 15.4)

### 15.3 Carbon cycling in Mediterranean pine forests
Carbon dioxide is produced in soils by roots and soil organisms, although non-biological processes may contribute to soil C0<sub>2</sub> efflux (Rey 2015). The movement of C0<sub>2</sub> from the soil to the atmosphere is controlled by the rate of C0<sub>2</sub> production in the soil, the difference of the C0<sub>2</sub> concentration between the soil and the atmosphere, and other properties such as soil texture, air temperature, and wind speed that modulate the movement of C0<sub>2</sub> through and out of the soil (Raich and Schlesinger 1992). Mean respiration rate in Mediterranean woodlands and heath was estimated in 713 g C/m<sup>2</sup>/año, a similar amount to those found for temperate coniferous forests, temperate deciduous forests and tropical dry forests (Raich and Schlesinger 1992). However, in some high pH soils (above 8) such as found in some Mediterranean soils, C0<sub>2</sub> efflux can be underestimated because CO<sub>2</sub> can be dissolved as bicarbonate in water (Angerkt et al. 2015). The relationship between soil respiration rate and primary production in the Mediterranean sites was higher than in the other ecosystems with similar rates (see Figure 1 in Raich and Schlesinger 1992), suggesting that in Mediterranean ecosystems conditions for microbial activity were relatively more favorable than for plant production.  
Soil respiration rates show a high temporal variability in Mediterranean ecosystems (Figure 15.5). In general, soil humidity and temperature are governing these rates, but in a complex pattern where wetting and drying events, seasons and root respiration interact to produce a complex temporal pattern (Carbone et al. 2011, Morillas et al. 2017). In a *Pinus muricata* forest in California Carbone et al. (2011) found that rainfall pulses derived from fog-drip, and precipitation after long dry periods, correlated with the largest soil respiration responses. In the same study, microbial respiration responded within hours to soil respiration drivers, whereas the response of root respiration delayed over days. They conclude that heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration respond differently in timing and quantity to moisture inputs. Sometimes a threshold in soil humidity or rainfall is needed for a response to a pulse of water availability. Matteucci et al. (2015) in a *Pinus pinaster* forest in Italy found that soil water availability controlled soil respiration from May to October but this control pass to soil temperature from November to March. High peaks were found only when rain pulses were greater than 10 mm on dry soil. Similarly, Inclan et al. (2007) in *Pinus sylvestris* and Pinus-oak stands in Central Spain showing minimum soil respiration rates in both winter and summer, found that those rates were highly influenced by soil temperatures when soil moisture was above a drought threshold of 15%. Below this threshold value, soil moisture was a good predictor of soil respiration in P stands.

Data were analyzed for the entire year and separately depending on the initial soil condition (dry or wet) before the start of the drying-wetting cycle. Error bars are ±SE, with N=8 for the annual average and N=4 for initial dry and wet soils. Significant differences are indicated as P < 0.05 (*), P < 0.01 (**), and P < 0.001 (***).From Morillas et al. (2017).*   
 
Although these studies measure soil respiration rates in response to changes in soil water, these rates are also affected by the timing of aboveground and belowground litter inputs, root exudates and changes in the microbial biomass. Also, soil enzymes are directly responsible for the decomposition of soil organic matter, and the resulting metabolites can be respired or assimilated by soil microbes. Soil enzymes activities were more intense in the litter layer than in soil in *Pinus nigra* stands in Central Spain (Lucas-Borja et al. 2019), but considering the soil volume, most enzyme activities are found in the bulk soil. The incorporation of these mechanisms gives more information on soil functioning than the mere measurement of soil C0<sub>2</sub> efflux, and should be incorporated into models of C dynamics during drying–wetting cycles (Lawrence et al. 2009). Thus, Zeglin et al. (2013) found a greater microbial C use efficiency in drier soils and in soils with prolonged dry periods between wetting events, with a lower potential for organic matter decomposition in drier soils after wetting events. They argue that soil microbial function may be linked with plant function (litter inputs, root exudates) and that microbial activity in dry soils might be driven by microorganisms surviving or growing efficiently during water deficit. The importance of the timing of precipitation, the length and intensity of the dry or wet period should be taken into account when evaluating the carbon functioning in Mediterranean ecosystems (Morillas et al. 2017).  

The response of soil microorganisms to drying-wetting cycles in Mediterranean forests and its implications for C cycling are complex (Schimel 2018). In general, microbial activity and soil respiration drop as soils dry (Carbone et al. 2011; Wu et al. 2011), but this decline vary greatly among studies. For example, Lu et al. (2017) found little response of soil respiration to large reductions in soil moisture. Sometimes a reduction in soil water content lead the augment of oxygen in the soil profile and the reactivation of aerobic microbial activity in saturated soils (Davidson et al. 2012). The main proposed mechanism involved in the reduction of microbial activity under low moisture conditions is a physiological response to stress (Schimel et al. 2007). However, the high diversity of responses to water stress by different groups of microorganisms is in contradiction with the common pattern of decrease in microbial activity with soil water potential (Manzoni et al 2010, Schimel 2018). As outlined above, the inclusion of extracellular enzymes activity may add some light to the relationship between soil respiration and the common drying-wetting cycles found in Mediterranean forests. A particular characteristic of extracellular enzymes rely on the need of lower water surfaces and volumes than microbial cells, which allows enzymes activity to operate longer with soil drying (Geisseler et al. 2011). However, depolymerization by extracellular enzymes, which is the first step leading to carbon oxidation, show variable responses to moisture (Sardans et al. 2008, Alster et al. 2013), perhaps because measurement of enzyme activity is the result of combining the amount of enzyme in soil, the individual activity of these molecules, the use of an artificial substrate and optimal conditions of temperature and moisture, which is far from natural conditions (German et al. 2011; Schimel et al. 2017; Schimel 2018). A review of studies using similar methods to measure extracellular soil enzymes activities in Mediterranean soils showed that activities of important extracellular enzymes linked to C, N and P cycles, such as urease, protease, β-glucosidase, and phosphatase were similar to those of other temperate ecosystems, suggesting that Mediterranean ecosystems invest similar amounts of resources to produce soil enzymes than more productive environments (Estiarte et al. 2008, Sardans and Peñuelas, 2013).

We are also far from a deep understanding of the rapid response of microbial activity to re-wetting (the Birch effect, Birch 1958; Goransson et al. 2013). Schimel (2018) review the process involved in this rapid response. The possibilities include the respiration of osmolites excreted by cells to regulate internal osmotic pressure upon re-wetting, the metabolism of the microbial corpses that died during the drought or during rewetting, and/or the mobilization of stable C by re-wetting resulting in a new C source available for microorganisms. Schimel (2018) conclude that if the pulse of carbon release is from microbial materials, drying–wetting cycling had little impact on long-term carbon loss from soil. But if the pulse comes from the mobilization of stable C, then drying-wetting cycles may have a long-term negative impact on soil C storage. Both mechanisms (carbon loss from microbial biomass and from mobilized stable C) can be operating simultaneously in a drying-wetting cycle. Thus, microbial biomass C would be the first source of C upon re-wetting and mobilized C may be used to replace lost biomass C (Schimel 2018).

### 15.3 Nitrogen cycling in Mediterranean pine forests  

Nitrogen cycling is also affected by drying-wetting cycles, and some principles discussed for the C cycling are applicable to N. Morillas et al. (2013) evaluated the effects of the continuous changes (weekly intervals for one year) in soil nitrogen (N) pools during natural wetting and drying events in a Mediterranean *Pinus pinea* forest, including microbial biomass [MB-N], dissolved organic nitrogen [DON], NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (Figure 15.6). All soil N fractions showed a complex pattern with high intraseasonal and interseasonal variability more notoriously in inorganic than organic N pools.

*Figure 15.6. (Top) Weekly soil microbial biomass-N and mineral-N in a Pinus pinea stand at southwest Spain. Blue bands indicate wetting events. (Bottom) Changes of soil microbial biomass-N, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and soil ammonium and nitrate concentration during wetting-drying cycles. Data were analyzed for the entire year and separately depending on the initial soil condition (dry or wet) before the start of the drying-wetting cycle. Error bars are ±SE, with N=8 for the annual average and N=4 for initial dry or wet soils. Significant differences are indicated as P < 0.05 (*), P < 0.01 (**), and P < 0.001 (***). From Morillas et al. (2013, 2017).* 

In Morillas et al. (2013), most soil N pools (MB-N, DON and resin-NH<sub>4</sub>) increased during wetting events, but remarkably,  soil NO<sub>3</sub> - and resin-NO<sub>3</sub> - showed the opposite trend, suggesting low nitrification or high denitrification response to water pulses. NO and N<sub>2</sub>O emission pulses upon re-wetting dry soils has been linked with the mobilization of mineral and organic N (Leitner et al. 2017). Morillas et al. (2013) concluded that changes in N pools were not coupled with changes in organic matter or labile C. Increases of N mineralization when dry soils are rewetted has been frequently found (Saetre and Stark 2005; Leitner et al. 2017). A rapid decrease of inorganic N followed by a pulse of ammonification 24 h after re-wetting has been observed (Placella et al. 2012; Goransson et al. 2013; Morillas et al. 2013; 2017). N mineralization dominating over immobilization upon re-wetting suggest that N rich substrates are available for soil microorganisms (Kleber et al. 2007; Liang et al. 2017). Nitrification and denitrification control N losses by leaching and or emissions of N<sub2>2</sub>O, NO or NO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere (Groffman and Tiedge 1988). Therefore, drying-wetting cycles may produce large amount of N losses as compared to C (Schimel 2018) which may uncover a mechanism of permanent N limitation in Mediterranean forests.  

### 15.4 Microbial community  
Microbial biomass and microbial activity is clearly influenced by drying-wetting cycles and seasonality in Mediterranean pine ecosystems (e.g. Figures 15.5 and 15.6). Microbial communities can be also influenced by weather and climate directly or indirectly (e.g. through seasonal changes in litter and exudates inputs, Bardgett et al. 2008). As mentioned above, physiological stress caused by drought or re-wetting may be the main cause of death of some groups of soil microorganisms but not others, leading to potential changes in the microbial composition of soils (Wu and Brookes 2005). Even if there is no death of microorganisms, some groups can be more active than others, been the active organisms (usually identified by their rRNA) a part of the whole microbial community. In a Mediterranean annual grassland of California re-wetting of soil provoked the increase of Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia, and the decrease of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes (Barnard et al. 2015). The proportion of Acidobacteria in the total community showed little seasonal changes, however the active part of Acidobacteria crashed in dry soils to become the second most dominant phylum during the wet season (Barnard et al. 2013). Fungi seems to be more resistant to drought than bacteria (Evans and Wallenstein 2012), thus becoming more abundant and active than bacteria in drier soils (Curiel-Yuste et al. 2011). Castaño et al. (2018) found in a *Pinus pinaster* forest that mycorrhizal fungi were less affected by summer drought than free-living fungi, particularly those mycorrhiza of the short-distance exploration type. Species of extensive mycelia type were more abundant under wetter conditions. Chowdhury et al. (2019) found that soil drying resulted in significant shifts of the soil microbiome, but few changes were found following re-wetting. They found that soil drying had not only changes in the structure and function of soil microorganisms but also affect metabolic pathways related with the production of osmolites. Schimel (2018) raise an interesting dilemma: whether microbial community dynamics drive the pulses of C0<sub>2</sub> following re-wetting, as suggested by several authors, or the way around, the pulse of C0<sub>2</sub> is led first by physical and chemical changes induced by rewetting, which subsequently fuel the response of the microbial community. The different timing between CO<sub>2</sub> pulse and microbes growth seem support this last view (Goransson et al. 2013).

### 15.5 Disturbance effect on soil functioning in Mediterranean pine forest  

Natural disturbance determines the structure and function of forest ecosystem (Attiwill 1994). Fire is the most extended and intense disturbance affecting Mediterranean ecosystems, with great impacts on soil functioning. Although many Mediterranean ecosystems are considered resilient to fire, pine forest are, with some exceptions, fire-sensitive (Pausas et al 2008). Wildfire in Mediterranean pine forests has a strong effect on soil soil organic matter, soil carbon and respiration (Certini et al. 2011; Hernández et al. 1997; Dadi et al. 2015; Uribe et al. 2013; Martínez-García et al. 2017; Lopez-Serrano et al. 2016). For example, Hernández et al. (1997) in *Pinus halepensis* and *Pinus pinaster* stands found that 9 months after fire the contents of organic, extractable and water-soluble C, humic acids, microbial biomass-C, basal soil respiration and dehydrogenase activity were, in general, lower than those of unburnt soils. Wildfire has also impact on fungal communities (Buscardo et al. 2014). The impact of wildfire on C cycling is proportional to the burn severity (Fernádez-García et al. 2019). Fire on pine forest also affected to soil nutrients and fertility. After a transient increase of soil available nutrients after fire, nutrient availability decrease as a consequence of leaching and erosion (Kutiel and Inbar, 1993; Pardini et al. 2003; Ferreira et al. 2016; Durán et al. 2008; 2009; 2010), leading to nutrient limitation and nutrient imbalance (Figure 15.7). In a third phase, nutrient availability recovers (Yildiz et al. 2010; Marañón-Jiménez et al. 2013; Marañón-Jiménez and Castro, 2013). Wildfire also affect the spatial pattern and local variability of nutrient availability (Rodríguez et al. 2009, Durán et al. 2019). Other types of ecological disturbances such as pests, parasites and insect outbreaks episodes are increasing in the Mediterranean area and affecting pine forest, sometimes attributed to warming, climatic change or biological invasions (Barbero et al. 1990; Hódar et al. 2003; Hódar and Zamora 2004; Hódar et al. 2012; Luchi et al. 2012; Pernek et al. 2019), with detected impacts in C, nutrient cycles and the microbial communities (Mellado et al. 2016, Mellado and Zamora, 2017).
